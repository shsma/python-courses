# REST APIs with Flask and Python

This repository contains code that is created in my course, REST APIs with Flask and Python.

The code is divided in folders, one for each section of the course which contains code.

## Section 2

The code is in files numbered between 1 and 11, covering concepts ranging from beginner to advanced.

1. Variables
2. Methods
3. Lists, tuples, and sets
4. If statements
5. List comprehension
6. Dictionaries
7. Classes and objects
8. Static and class methods
9. Args and Kwargs
10. Passing functions as arguments
11. Decorators

## Section 3

The code in this section includes a simple Flask app and a HTML and JavaScript file which calls the Flask app endpoints.

## Section 4

The code in this section includes a Flask app which is an API that represents items. It also includes user registration and authentication.

## Section 5

The code in this section extends the last section by adding persistent storage of Items to a SQLite database.

## Section 6

The code in this section extends the previous section by replacing the manual integration with SQLite, with SQLAlchemy—an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)—which allows us to easily replace SQLite with something like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
